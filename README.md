Naukri.com
Naukri.com is an Indian employment website operating in India and Middle East. Naukri.com was founded in March 1997 by Indian businessman Sanjeev Bikhchandani, who started Info Edge (India) Ltd. in 1995. 

I tried to clone the Naukri.com website from the scratch. For this, We have used the HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
